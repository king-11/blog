When you are working in a large code base comprising of **multiple** micro services maybe in a single repository your work would require you to make progress on multiple **features** simultaneously.

There comes in a lot of context switching which in `git` terminology means multiple **branches**. The flow can become *cumbersome* when you keep `stashing` and `checking` out. Let's see how that looks like.

## What is the problem?

Let's say I am working on a long term new feature in my freshly checked out branch `lakshyasingh/feature-python`. Now I made some progress on the feature and its not yet fully ready some changes are still present in the working tree and not yet committed.
```bash
git add detection_model.py
git commit -m "detection model new algorithm"
```

Now I am bored of working on this `python` feature and its gonna take some more time, meanwhile I can make progress on another important feature for `dotnet` which is in `lakshyasingh/feature-dotnet`.

So to switch to that branch and to not lose uncommitted changes present in python feature I will stash and then checkout.
```bash
# stash the uncommitted changes
git stash --include-untracked -m "feature python stash"
git checkout lakshyasingh/feature-dotnet
```

Given it also an unsaid responsibility to review pull request created by other contributors.

I move onto that task and checkout to branch created by them
```bash
# stash the uncommitted changes
git stash --include-untracked -m "feature dotnet stash"
git checkout bhavyakala/feature-scala
```

Now you see what the problem here is my git stash starts to look like my commit history
```bash
git stash list
stash@{0}: On lakshyasingh/feature-python: feature python stash
stash@{1}: On lakshyasingh/feature-dotnet: feature dotnet stash
stash@{2}: On lakshyasingh/java-coverage
```

Moreover there is an issue as the flow of things break as you `stash` and `checkout`. Your working tree might be in a state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you didnâ€™t wish to risk disturbing.

## Isolated Working Areas
Git works in three areas:
- Working Area
- Staging Area
- Repository

When we `stash` changes we are cleaning up the `working area`. Moving to a different `branch` switches the `repository` to a different `working area`.
```mermaid
graph LR
	W[(Working Area)] -->|add| S[(Staging Area)]
	S -->|commit| R[(Repository)]

	R --> |checkout branch|W
```

You might think that **cloning** your repository into *multiple folder* is a solution but its a bad one as:
- The data will **duplicated** for the git repository.
- They won't **share** any new updates that you make in them locally.
- You will have to perform operations like `fetch` and `pull` on both the clones separately.

There exists only one working area at any point but if we had *multiple working areas* we wouldn't need to clear up one to use other. Indeed, a git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check out more than one branch at a time using `git worktree`.
```mermaid
graph TD
	P[(feature python)] -->|add| PS[(Staging Area 1)]
	D[(feature dotnet)] -->|add| DS[(Staging Area 2)]
	S[(feature scala)] -->|add| SS[(Staging Area 3)]

	PS -->|commit| R[(Repository)]
	DS -->|commit| R
	SS -->|commit| R
```

## Git WorkTree
So using `git worktree` we can work on multiple branches at the same time. We can even think of it as "multi checkout \<branch1\> \<branch2\>"

So let's use git worktree for the above scenario how will that help us. First of all will create 3 new empty folders to hold the dirty changes for each work tree.
```
projects
â”œâ”€â”€ project1-python
â”œâ”€â”€ project1-review
â”œâ”€â”€ project1-dotnet
â””â”€â”€ project1
```

Our repository is currently cloned in `project1` directory. We will create a new worktree for all python related work and store it `project1-python` directory and create a new branch `lakshyasingh/feature-python`
```bash
cd project1
git worktree add -b lakshyasingh/feature-python ../project1-python main
```

Similarly we will create different work tree for `dotnet` and `review` purposes.
```bash
git worktree add -b lakshyasingh/feature-dotnet ../project1-dotnet main
# checkout to already existing branch in remote repository
git worktree add ../project1-review bhavyakala/feature-scala
```

Our main branch will remain checked in `project1` directory.

Now the task of context switching is as easy as changing folders and your uncommitted changes will still be present in each isolated worktree.

### Caveats
You can go into any of the created worktree folders and run all the supported `git` commands there to modify the repository. All the common things `remote`, `stash`, `branch`, etc. are connected even though in different folder.

The most important thing to remember when working with worktrees is that
>You can only checkout a branch into one worktree at a time.

In case you delete the folder associated with any of the worktree the data present there will be lost along with metadata details. A better way to handle worktree deletion while keeping you uncommitted changes would be as below
```bash
# if there is uncommitted changes stash them
git stash --include-untracked -m "<message>"
cd ../project1
git worktree remove ../project1-dotnet
```

If you don't care about the uncommitted changes in working area you can go all *YOLO* with `-f` flag.

In case you move around the linked worktree's by renaming the folder or changing its location the worktree reference will be lost.
```bash
mv project1-python project1-py

git worktree list
/home/king11/projects/project1            8b526a3 [main]
/home/king11/projects/project1-python     8b526a3 [feature-python] prunable
/home/king11/projects/project1-dotnet     8b526a3 [feature-dotnet]
```

The worktree is listed as `prunable` and `git` will clear it soon all the metadata present there. To fix this we can run `repair` to bring back the association
```bash
cd proejct1
git worktree repair ../project1-py
```

We can provide multiple paths in case many worktrees were moved together.

## Conclusion
Git worktree is a good utility tool to use when you have a large code base and team at your hand to collaborate with. There is no denying that `stashing` and `checkout` is faster but after the initial process of setting up worktrees is done its a smooth ride to sail along.

Also given git is one of my most favourite topics there is so much more to explore and learn, a true marvel of a **distributed system** powering most of the large scale systems today.
