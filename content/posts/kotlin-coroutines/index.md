title: Kotlin Coroutines
description: Joy of writing in Kotlin brings us to coroutines, the concurrency primitive which scale. They come under the category of lightweight green threads. As expected of Kotlin, it has built in methods/functions to cater to all your requirements of concurrency for building the next big thing while sipping on hot "Java".

# Coroutine

A `coroutine` is an instance of a **suspend-able computation**. It is conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works **concurrently** with the rest of the code.

However, a coroutine is not *bound* to any particular user level thread. It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one. This scheduling of coroutines is handled by the Kotlin `dispatchers` similar to [go runtime](https://king-11.github.io/blog/posts/goroutines/#go-runtime-components)

Coroutines are **less resource-intensive** than JVM threads. Code that exhausts the JVM's available **memory** when using threads can be expressed using coroutines without hitting resource limits.

## Suspending Function
Suspending functions are at the heart of coroutines. They can **use other suspending functions** (like delay in this example) to **suspend** execution of a coroutine and free the thread for useful computation by other coroutines.
```kotlin
suspend fun doWorld() {
    delay(1000L)
    println("World!")
}
```

## Coroutine Builders
To actually build a coroutine we need to use coroutine builders which cater to multiple different scenarios where coroutines can be used.

### Launch
A `launch` coroutine builder returns a `Job` object that is a handle to the launched coroutine and can be used to explicitly wait for its completion.
```kotlin
launch { // launch a new coroutine
	delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms)
	println("World!") // print after delay
}
```

### CoroutineScope
A `coroutineScope` builder can be used inside any suspending function to perform multiple concurrent operations
```kotlin
// Concurrently executes both sections
suspend fun doWorld() = coroutineScope { // this: CoroutineScope
    launch {
        delay(2000L)
        println("World 2")
    }
    launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("World 1")
    }
    println("Hello")
}
```

The main difference from `runBlocking` method is that it **blocks** the current thread for waiting, while `coroutineScope` just **suspends**, releasing the underlying thread for other usages. Because of that difference, `runBlocking` is a regular function and `coroutineScope` is a suspending function.

### Produce
We can also use `produce` builder where a coroutine is producing a **sequence/stream** of elements (very common in *producer consumer patterns*)
```kotlin
// infinite stream of integers starting from 1
fun CoroutineScope.produceNumbers() = produce<Int> {
	var x = 1
	while (true) send(x++)
}
```

>**Note:** All functions that create coroutines are defined as extensions on CoroutineScope, so that we can rely on [structured concurrency](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/composing-suspending-functions.html#structured-concurrency-with-async) to make sure that we don't have lingering global coroutines in our application.

### Async
There is another builder, `async` it is quite similar to `launch`. It creates a single coroutine but instead of forgetting about return value like the case with `launch` returned `Job`, `async` returns a `Deferred` (non-blocking future) that represents a promise to provide result using `.await()`.
```kotlin
val one = async { doSomethingUsefulOne() }
println("The answer is ${one.await()}")
```

Optionally, we can make `async` lazy as follows:
```kotlin
val one = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) { doSomethingUsefulOne() }
one.start() // start lazily
```

Now that we have a concurrent environment where multiple coroutines are working simultaneously, we need mechanisms to synchronize data access/communication.

# Channels
Channels are **communication primitives** that allow data to be passed between coroutines. One coroutine can *send* some information to a channel, while another can *receive* that information from it in a **thread safe manner**.

![working of kotlin channels](./channel.webp)

`Channel` is represented by three different interfaces: `SendChannel`, `ReceiveChannel`, and `Channel`, with the latter extending the first two.

There are multiple kinds of channels:
- Unlimited Channel
- Buffered Channel
- Rendezvous Channel
- Conflated Channel
```kotlin
val rendezvousChannel = Channel<String>()
val bufferedChannel = Channel<String>(10)
val conflatedChannel = Channel<String>(CONFLATED)
val unlimitedChannel = Channel<String>(UNLIMITED)
```

***Note***: Both `Channel` factory function and [produce](#produce) builder take an optional `capacity` parameter to specify _buffer size_.

## Sending and Receiving
A Channel is conceptually very similar to `BlockingQueue`, except that its methods aren't blocking and instead of **suspending** nature.

| Blocking | Suspending |
| :--: | ---- |
| put | send |
| take | receive |

```kotlin
val channel = Channel<Int>()
launch {
    // this might be heavy CPU-consuming computation or async logic, we'll just send five squares
    for (x in 1..5) channel.send(x * x)
}
// here we print five received integers:
repeat(5) { println(channel.receive()) }
println("Done!")
```
>Channel `send` or `receive` functions can suspend when the channel is **full** or **empty** respectively. The channel can be **full** if the channel size has an upper bound.

## Closing
The producer can close a channel to indicate that no more elements are coming. Conceptually, a [close](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.channels/-send-channel/close.html) is like sending a special close token to the channel.

A receiver iterating on channel stops as soon as this close token is received, so there is a guarantee that all previously sent elements before the close are received.
```kotlin
launch {
    for (x in 1..5) channel.send(x * x)
    channel.close() // we're done sending
}
// here we print received values using `for` loop (until the channel is closed)
for (y in channel) println(y)
```

# Patterns
We can use the channel data structure to implement multiple concurrency patterns frequently used in concurrent/parallel programming.

## Producer-Consumer
Channels simplify implementation of *producer consumer pattern* in kotlin to a large extent with a large set of easy to use functions. We can use the `produce` builder on producer side and an extension function `consumeEach`, that replaces a `for` loop on the consumer side.
```kotlin
// producer builder channel
val squares = produceSquares()
// consumeEach utility
squares.consumeEach { println(it) }
```

## Fan-out

![fan out](fan-out.webp)

**Multiple** coroutines may **receive** from the same channel, distributing work between themselves. Unlike `consumeEach`, `for` loop pattern is the safe option to use when multiple coroutines are receiving because a consumer written via `consumeEach` always consumes (cancels) the underlying channel on its normal or abnormal completion leaving other coroutines aborted as well.

# Shared Data
Coroutines can be executed parallelly using a multi-threaded dispatcher like the `Dispatchers.Default`. Given the scenario of parallel data access we have to prevent unpredictable behaviour of data.

## Volatile
There is a common misconception that making a variable `volatile` solves concurrency problem, because volatile variables just guarantee **atomic reads** and **writes** to the corresponding variable, but do not provide atomicity of a **larger action** (like addition, subtraction, etc.)
```kotlin
@Volatile // in Kotlin `volatile` is an annotation
var counter = 0
```

## Thread Safe Data Structure
A thread-safe (aka synchronized, linearizable, or atomic) data structure provides all the necessary **synchronization** for the operations that needs to be performed on a shared state.
```kotlin
val counter = AtomicInteger()
```

This is the **fastest** and most **versatile** solution for this particular problem. It works for plain counters, collections, queues and other standard data structures and basic operations on them. However, it does **not** easily scale to **complex state** or to complex operations that do not have ready-to-use thread-safe implementations.

## Thread Confinement
Thread confinement is an approach to the problem of shared mutable state where all **access** to the particular shared state is **confined** to a **single thread**.
```kotlin
// confine each increment to a single-threaded context
withContext(counterContext) {
    counter++
}
```

This code works very **slowly**, because it does fine-grained thread-confinement. In practice, thread confinement is performed in **large chunk**s, e.g. big pieces of state-updating business logic are confined to the single thread.

## Mutex
Coroutines have `Mutex`. It has `lock` and `unlock` functions to delimit a critical section. `Mutex.lock()` is a **suspending** function which does not block a thread. There is also `withLock` extension function that conveniently represents:
```kotlin
mutex.lock()
try { ... }
finally { mutex.unlock() }

// using withLock
withLock(mutex) {
    try { ... }
}
```

# Cancellation

![popatlal cancel cancel](https://media1.tenor.com/m/Ij-f8xRraN8AAAAd/popatlal-cancel.gif)

Just launching the coroutine isn't sufficient, at times even the good humans of this world have to become a part of **cancel culture** set by *Mr. Popatlal* to cancel some long running background coroutine.
```kotlin
var job = launch {
	delay(500L) // i will sleep
}
delay(200L)
println("cancel culture ftw")
job.cancel() // ask it to cancel
job.join() // wait for it to complete
```

> There is also a `cancelAndJoin` utility method.

## Cooperative
Coroutine Cancellation is of **cooperative nature**, the cancelled coroutine has to agree with cancellation and stop the computation. If a coroutine isn't actively checking for cancellation signal then it can't be cancelled.

All the suspending functions in `kotlinx.coroutines` are cancellable, they actively check for cancellation signal and then throw a `CancellationException` when cancelled. So we shouldn't catch `CancellationException` without intent of stopping the computation.
```
try {
	delay(500)
} catch (e: Exception) {
	// log the exception, might have been a `CancellationException`
	println(e)
}
```

## Cancellable Computation
To ensure that the library or program that we write aligns with the cancellation requirements we can pursue below two options:
- Calling the `yield` suspending function which checks for cancellation at regular intervals inside the coroutine.
```kotlin
launch {
    while (true) {
        // large computation
        yield()
    }
}
```
- Checking the `isActive` extension property available inside the coroutine via `CoroutineScope` object
```kotlin
launch {
    while (isActive) {
        // large computation
    }
}
```

# Conclusion
Kotlin is an amazing language I genuinely had fun writing code in it during 2023's [Advent of Code](http://github.com/king-11/AdventOfCode) ~~which I didn't complete :'(~~. I have felt this feeling last with `C#` and `Golang` ~~not rust~~. Let's cover this thought about joy of programming in a well articulated blog later so stay tuned.

Thanks for reading, you guys keep me going I am planning to start publishing my blogs on `Medium` as well for better reach to increase my [Luck Surface Area](https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work) till then adios, **Happy Makar Sankranti** may the wind gods be with you :) and yeah you know where to find me [@1108King](http://twitter.com/1108King)
