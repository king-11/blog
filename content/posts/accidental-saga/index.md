## Foreword

I have been planning to write this down for quite sometime now, and the first words of this blog post are being written just a before the one year ~anniversary~ mark of the accident. Earlier a shock used to go down my spine everytime someone asked me about the accident:
- why I can't rotate my neck beyond 50% of normal human capacity,
- why are there two scars the front and back of my neck,
- why do I have to take rest after longer periods of sitting,
- why can't a go in adventurous rides like my friends,
- why can't I bench press or do a few other gym workouts

All these questions are still there but I have started treating them casually, I don't cry over them anymore _"it is what it is :P"_ and I try to live out my life like everyone else does with a fair share of troubles.

My co-accidentee Nishtha told me not to stick to the past as it is always going to be painful to remember those traumatic times but move on and not bother writing this post. I agree to some extent but this accident gave me a different view of life along with several learnings which I don't hope anyone to learn the way I did. So ignoring Nishtha like she ignores my relationship advices am writing this down to keep a memory of all the things that my future self would be proud of and remember of how we made it through :).
