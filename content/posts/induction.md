## Background JEE

A little background about me before I start my journey. I am Lakshya Singh, a resident of Jaipur, Rajasthan did my JEE prep from FIITJEE Jaipur. I was amongst the top of my batch, qualifying for KVPY SA and SX, NSEJS, INChO (went for camp), NSEP, etc. I got JEE Mains AIR 376 and Jee Advance Rank AIR 598.

A clear thought was that I wanted to pursue CSE because I enjoyed the technical space; watching my father work on MS Excel, playing video games, and developing software was all too fascinating for me. I joined **भारतीय प्रौद्योगिकी संस्थान (काशी हिंदू विश्वविद्यालय) काशी**, which I didn't even know existed before.

## Entering UP65

I with my father and uncle, came to `Aryabhatta` met the other two one was `Lakshya (MAT'24)` and other was `Lakshay (MEC'23)`. The stalls were there for purchasing stuff we bought a cycle too along with everything else which I still regret because you can get same cycle at half rate from Lanka.

Papa got me in touch with a senior `Monica Di (EEE 21`) she came around at 9:30PM and with one of her friend we went to Assi tripling. I was worried about getting late since we were supposed to be inside by 10 PM I like the most innocent faacha went to di ki “late hojaye to andar nahi jane denge :” she introduced me to the most fondly used sentence “chill hai” and we went back nodoby to ask anything. She also introduced me to the concept of tech dad and I went on the search of mine.

Next day Papa came around we went for registration in the Civil department in one of the Gs, also had to visit HG through the unpaved alley we got the necessary printouts. Finally, there was a session in the CSE department (the LT2) where `HOD sir (Rajeev Srivastava`) came around and said some things then we went about introducing ourselves all 112 I remember using the cliched `Pinkcity` word.

Finally, we came back to the hostel and it was time for Papa to leave at that moment I knew *“you are on your own buddy”* with a few tears in my eye I said goodbye to papa and came back to my room `B208`.

## Induction

The induction by **SCS** starts which lasted for around 7 days, the seniors tried to scare us of the fact that if our attendance isn't at par with some limit we would be doing the induction again with next faachas so we tried best to just go there and sleep in the AC of **Swatantra Bhawan**. Kushal and Lakshya used to save me seat in there at 1st floor the least probable place to be found asleep.

The best session we all were excited about was `H.C. Verma` sir and that was amazing getting to know about such a great personality and all his monkeys. Rest all were tabla and inspiration sessions which we preferred sleeping over rather. There was another good session which was the screening of `Yeh Zindagi Nah Milegi Dobara`.

Then there were also the morning sessions at gymkhana, they used to distribute bananas and ig there was one more thing along with that. One day we also were sent with our Induction Mentor still don't know who to Bharatiya Kala Mandir on the way I finally found the guy who at AIR 509 took BHU CSE instead of Guwahati our Kholu, `Sharabh Agarwal`. Also on the bus I met `Ritik (CSE'24)` and `Abhishek (CSE'23)`.

I also recall `Neeraj Bhaiya` (CSE'21) , the SCS Head of the time coming over to meet the CSE freshers in aryabhatta, he told us to be prepared with our intros as seniors would be asking and 4th year would be taking it well so be prepared.


## Hostel Daze

I found out my roommates have made new friends, met `Kushal (MAT'24)` that day and maybe the other creatures from MNC department too who planned on taking over my room soon enough. which was the best thing that might have happened in the first year for me.

The campus initially felt like a maze in which I found myself lost without google maps but it was recommended not to use it because of its unreliability and preferring finding the ways out.

### Finding Tech Dad

Going back to the tech dad part I was very excited to meet mine eventually I found out that I was Deparment Rank 3rd there was Sharabh and Anshu before me so based on that I asked `Dvij bhaiya (CSE'22)` about who was 3rd in their batch he told me it was `Yash Bhaiya (CSE'22)`. I contacted him, he told me to drop down at CV Raman the hostel on edge of our campus. It was scary for me what would seniors do, would they be taking my ragging but hell a junior who has been in campus for 3 days went inside the seniors hostel.

Well nothing of sorts happended dont get your hopes high. Yash bhaiya was very kind to me all throughout college, he introduced me to the other people of his batch including `Ishmeet` Bhaiya at that time he had good CPI so told me about a few things how to ace exams. Finally I went back filled with joy of meeting new people.
